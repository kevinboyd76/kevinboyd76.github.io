# 1) Project Description

**CutAndTag_ReplicatePeak_Analysis** is a Snakemake pipeline designed to perform downstream analysis on processed Cut-and-Tag sequencing data. Rather than starting from raw FASTQ reads, this pipeline starts with already aligned and filtered BAM files, focusing on the identification of reproducible peaks, the generation of consensus peak sets, and the visualization of overlaps and signal distributions across multiple samples or experimental conditions.

+ Note: If you are starting from raw FASTQ files, consider using the [CutandTag_Analysis_Snakemake](https://github.com/JK-Cobre-Help/CutandTag_Analysis_Snakemake) pipeline first. That pipeline handles the initial data processing steps—such as quality control, alignment, and basic filtering—providing you with the cleaned and aligned data that serve as the input for CutAndTag_ReplicatePeak_Analysis.

## Key Features

- **Peak Calling with MACS2 on Individual and Merged Samples**:
  Each replicate is processed independently using MACS2 to call peaks. In parallel, biological replicates defined by the `Set` column in `samples.csv` are merged at the BAM level, and a second MACS2 peak calling is performed on the merged BAM to capture reproducible signal across replicates.

- **Reproducible Consensus Peak Sets**:
  A consensus peak set is generated by comparing merged peaks to individual replicate peaks. Peaks are retained only if they are supported by a minimum number of replicates found in the `congif.yml` (e.g., 2 out of 3), ensuring biological reproducibility while reducing noise.

- **Signal Preservation Through Merged Read Support**:
  Reads are extracted directly from the merged BAM preserving read-level signal. This enables more accurate representation of genomic signal in consensus peak regions.

- **Consensus Peak Conversion to Visualization Formats**:
  Consensus peak regions are used to extract reads and generate sorted BAM and BigWig files. These outputs are optimized for visualization in genome browsers and for downstream comparative analysis.

- **Euler Plots of Replicate and Condition Overlaps**:
  Euler diagrams are created to visualize how consensus peaks arise from replicate overlaps within a set. Additional Euler plots show condition-level peak set relationships for each mark, providing clear insight into reproducibility and condition-specific differences. Euler plots color and size can be set in the `config.yml`.

- **Midpoint and Overlap Quantification**:
  Consensus peaks are processed to determine their midpoints and identify overlaps across all sets. This provides a standardized reference point for comparing distributions and regional enrichments.

- **High-Resolution Heatmaps of Signal Intensity**:
  The pipeline generates heatmaps centered on consensus peak midpoints. These plots visualize the distribution and intensity of signal across replicates, conditions, or sample sets, making trends in coverage and peak architecture easy to interpret. Heatmaps are customizable in the `config.yml` along with the ability to toggle them on and off. In the `sampleOrder` section the first sample will set the order of the bed file in the heatmap.

# 2) Intended Use Case
This pipeline is ideal for researchers who have already processed their Cut-and-Tag data through preliminary steps such as quality control, alignment, and filtering (e.g., by using [CutandTag_Analysis_Snakemake](https://github.com/JK-Cobre-Help/CutandTag_Analysis_Snakemake)). After obtaining high-quality aligned BAM files, you can use CutAndTag_ReplicatePeak_Analysis to:

- Identify reproducible peaks across replicates or experimental conditions.
- Generate integrative visual summaries of peak overlaps.
- Compare signal intensity profiles around consensus peak midpoints.

By integrating this two-step approach, you ensure a robust, end-to-end workflow for your Cut-and-Tag sequencing experiments.

# 3) Dependencies and Configuration

All parameters (e.g., genome size, MACS2 q-values, minimum number of overlapping samples for consensus peaks, paths to executables) are controlled via the `config/config.yml` file.

## Explanation of `config.yml`
- Note. Make sure to check config.yml for the appropriate genome

The `config.yml` file controls genome settings, tool versions, and other workflow parameters.

## Changing Genomes
By default, the `config.yml` is set up for mouse (mm10). Running human (hg38) samples requires changing these values to match the hg38 parameters, which are already provided in `config.yml` as comments.

To switch from mm10 to hg38 (or vice versa), you’ll need to change:
- **Genome and Effective Genome Size**:
  Update genome and effective genomes sizes
  - For human (hg38), set `genome: "hs"` and `effective_genome_size: 2913022398`
  - For mouse (mm10), set `genome: "mm"` and `effective_genome_size: 2730871774`

- **Chrom_sizes File**:
  Point chrom_sizes to the correct chromosome sizes file.
  - For human (hg38), set `resources/hg38.chrom.sizes`
  - For mouse (mm10), set `resources/mm10.chrom.sizes`

All information required for switching between hg38 and mm10 is included in `config.yml`, commented out next to the default settings. Simply uncomment and modify these values as needed when changing the genome from mm10 to hg38.

Tool Versions and Modules
The `config.yml` file also specifies versions of tools and modules (e.g., deeptools, macs2, samtools, bedtools, R) used by the pipeline. These versions help maintain reproducibility and ensure that the pipeline runs consistently across different computing environments.

# 4) Tools & Modules
The pipeline relies on bioinformatics tools, including:

- **MACS2** for peak calling
- **bedtools** and samtools for peak and alignment format conversions
- **deeptools** for coverage and matrix computation, as well as for generating heatmaps
- **R** with **Bioconductor** packages for merging peaks, checking overlap, creating midpoints, and creating **Euler** diagrams

# 5) Example Data
A compact, pre-processed dataset aligned to mm10 is included in this repository to quickly test the pipeline and validate that your environment is set up correctly. This small example replicates the pipeline’s key steps from peak calling through to final visualization. Visualization examlpes are shown below in section 7.

# 6) Explanation of `samples.csv`
Note. Make sure to check `sample.csv` before each run

`samples.csv` specifies the samples to analyze, their BAM file locations, and how they are grouped into sets. The file has three columns: `sample`, `bam`, and `set`.

**Example `samples.csv`:**
```csv
sample,bam,set,mark,condition
H3K27ac_rep1_C,resources/H3K27ac_rep1_C_PB042_chr1_1_10Mb.bam,H3K27ac_C,H3K27ac,C
H3K27ac_rep1_T,resources/H3K27ac_rep1_T_PB045_chr1_1_10Mb.bam,H3K27ac_T,H3K27ac,T
H3K27ac_rep2_C,resources/H3K27ac_rep2_C_PB052_chr1_1_10Mb.bam,H3K27ac_C,H3K27ac,C
H3K27ac_rep2_T,resources/H3K27ac_rep2_T_PB055_chr1_1_10Mb.bam,H3K27ac_T,H3K27ac,T
H3K27ac_rep3_C,resources/H3K27ac_rep3_C_PB062_chr1_1_10Mb.bam,H3K27ac_C,H3K27ac,C
H3K27ac_rep3_T,resources/H3K27ac_rep3_T_PB065_chr1_1_10Mb.bam,H3K27ac_T,H3K27ac,T
```

`sample`: Unique sample name  
  - used for individual sample output filenames and to identify samples in consensus peak euler plot  
    
`bam`: Path to the aligned BAM file  
  - sorted.bam is usually best but other .bam files can be used  
    
`set`: Sample grouping for consensus peak analysis 
  - **{mark}_{condition}**
  - sets naming for consensus peak files downstream. All samples with the same **Set** name will be combined to generate a consensus peak set.
  - MUST MATCH MARK AND CONDITION (Ex: H3K27ac_Control or H3K27ac_C)
  
`mark`: Indicates the type of histone mark or other feature captured
  - all samples with the same mark name will be grouped for subsequent control vs treatment plots
  - MUST MATCH MARK NAME IN SET

`condition`: Specifies the experimental condition
  - these values are used to distinguish groups in control vs treatment overlap plots for each mark
  - MUST MATCH CONDITION NAME IN SET

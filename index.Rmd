My name is **Kevin Boyd** — a data scientist and bioinformatician with a passion for utilizing complex data into actionable insights. I currently live in Oklahoma and work as a Senior Bioinformatic Analyst. I specialize in statistical modeling, data visualization, image analysis, and building end-to-end data pipelines with R and Python.

# Overview

This section highlights specific projects that I completed during my graduate training in data science at SMU. These projects cover statistical modeling, classification, clustering, and visualization — using R, Python, and Shiny.

## Budweiser Marketing Case Study

**Goal**:  Identify errors and recognize patterns that are present in the beers and breweries data sets given to us by Budweiser. We also want to determine if there is a relationship between ABV (alcohol by volume) and IBU (international bitterness units).

- Explored k-means clustering and PCA
- Visualized brand clusters in 2D PCA space
- Presented results in an academic setting

## Employee Attrition Prediction

**Goal**: Identify factors that predict employee attrition based on statistical analysis. Finally build a classification model that can predict attrition and salary.

- Trained Naive Bayes, k-NN, and linear regression models
- Evaluated classification models on accuracy, precision, recall
- Evaluated linear regression model on RMSE and p-value.

## Central Limit Theorem Simulation

**Goal**: Visualize how the CLT emerges with increasing sample sizes.

- Simulated 10,000 draws from various distributions
- Showed how sampling distributions approach normality
- Used animated ggplot2 to demonstrate convergence

## Notes

These projects were developed as part of SMU's Data Science graduate program (2021–2022) and reflect foundational skill development across applied machine learning, statistics, and data storytelling.
